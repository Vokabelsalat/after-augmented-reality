# Deploying on a Linux server with Caddy

The app runs as one persistent Next.js Node process on `127.0.0.1:3066`. Caddy sits in front of it, terminates HTTPS and proxies requests to that port. HTTPS is required: phones only allow camera access, and therefore AR scanning, on secure origins.

This is not a static export. The contribution API (`/api/contributions`) and its SQLite database need the Node server.

The commands assume Ubuntu or Debian and use:

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Application checkout | `/opt/after-augmented-reality` |
| SQLite database | `/var/lib/after-augmented-reality/exhibition.sqlite` |
| Environment file | `/etc/after-augmented-reality.env` |
| Service account | `afterar` |
| Next.js listener | `127.0.0.1:3066` (private) |
| Public domain | `exhibition.example.com` (replace with yours) |

Before you start, point the domain's DNS `A` and/or `AAAA` record at the server and open inbound ports 80 and 443.

## 1. Install Node.js

The contribution database uses the built-in `node:sqlite` module, so the server needs **Node.js 22.13 or newer** (Node 24 LTS is a good choice). Install it from [NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) or your preferred source, then check:

```bash
node --version   # v22.13.0 or newer
command -v npm   # note this path for the systemd unit
```

`npm ci` installs the `canvas` package (used by MindAR's tooling). Prebuilt binaries cover common x64 and arm64 Linux systems. If the install falls back to compiling it, install the build dependencies and run `npm ci` again:

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev \
  libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev
```

## 2. Create the service account and directories

```bash
sudo adduser --system --group --home /opt/after-augmented-reality afterar

sudo install -d -o afterar -g afterar \
  /opt/after-augmented-reality \
  /var/lib/after-augmented-reality
```

Clone the repository into `/opt/after-augmented-reality` and hand it to the service account:

```bash
sudo git clone <repository-url> /opt/after-augmented-reality
sudo chown -R afterar:afterar /opt/after-augmented-reality
```

## 3. Add the production environment

Create an environment file that only root and the service account can read:

```bash
sudo install -m 0640 -o root -g afterar /dev/null /etc/after-augmented-reality.env
sudoedit /etc/after-augmented-reality.env
```

Add:

```ini
NODE_ENV=production
EXHIBITION_DATABASE_PATH=/var/lib/after-augmented-reality/exhibition.sqlite
NEXT_PUBLIC_VISUALIZATION_DESIGN=fish
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_VISUALIZATION_DESIGN` is baked into the client bundle at build time. Set it to `fish`, `creature` or `constellation` before building; changing it later requires a rebuild.

## 4. Install dependencies and build

```bash
sudo -u afterar sh -c '
  cd /opt/after-augmented-reality
  set -a; . /etc/after-augmented-reality.env; set +a
  npm ci --include=dev
  npm run build
'
```

`--include=dev` matters: with `NODE_ENV=production` set, npm would otherwise skip the devDependencies (Tailwind, PostCSS, TypeScript) that the build needs.

## 5. Run Next.js on port 3066 with systemd

```bash
sudoedit /etc/systemd/system/after-augmented-reality.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=The Fishbowl Leaks
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=afterar
Group=afterar
WorkingDirectory=/opt/after-augmented-reality
EnvironmentFile=/etc/after-augmented-reality.env
ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm run start -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3066

Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
TimeoutStopSec=30
KillSignal=SIGTERM
UMask=0027

NoNewPrivileges=true
PrivateTmp=true
ProtectHome=true
ProtectSystem=full

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

If `command -v npm` printed something other than `/usr/bin/npm`, use that path in `ExecStart`.

Start it and check that it answers on the loopback interface only:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now after-augmented-reality
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:3066
```

Port 3066 must not be reachable from outside; only Caddy talks to it.

## 6. Install Caddy

Use the [official Caddy package](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install#debian-ubuntu-raspbian):

```bash
sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
sudo chmod o+r /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install caddy
```

## 7. Proxy the domain to port 3066

```bash
sudoedit /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

```caddyfile
exhibition.example.com {
    encode zstd gzip
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3066
}
```

Caddy obtains and renews the TLS certificate itself and redirects HTTP to HTTPS. Validate and reload:

```bash
sudo caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

If UFW is enabled, open HTTP and HTTPS:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Caddy Full'
```

Check the public site:

```bash
curl -I https://exhibition.example.com
```

Then open these on a phone and on the exhibition display:

- `https://exhibition.example.com/`: the visitor app (allow camera access when asked)
- `https://exhibition.example.com/collective`: the shared screen, opened full-screen on the display
- `https://exhibition.example.com/particles`: the particle constellation gallery

## Updating to a new version

```bash
sudo -u afterar sh -c '
  cd /opt/after-augmented-reality
  git pull
  set -a; . /etc/after-augmented-reality.env; set +a
  npm ci --include=dev
  npm run build
'
sudo systemctl restart after-augmented-reality
```

The build replaces `.next/` while the old process is still serving from it, so pages can fail briefly until the restart. Update outside opening hours.

If you change particle shapes or target images, run `npm run targets:export`, `npm run targets:compile` and `npm run targets:verify` locally, then commit the new `public/targets/` files before pulling them on the server.

## Data and backups

Submitted visitor stories live in `/var/lib/after-augmented-reality/exhibition.sqlite`, outside the checkout, so updates never touch them. Back up that directory, including any `-wal` and `-shm` files next to the database. For a consistent copy while the app runs, either stop the service briefly or use:

```bash
sudo -u afterar sqlite3 /var/lib/after-augmented-reality/exhibition.sqlite \
  ".backup '/var/lib/after-augmented-reality/backup-$(date +%F).sqlite'"
```

Run only one app instance against this database.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| `502 Bad Gateway` from Caddy | The app is not running on 3066: `sudo systemctl status after-augmented-reality` and `sudo journalctl -u after-augmented-reality -n 100` |
| Service exits with `No such built-in module: node:sqlite` | Node is older than 22.13; upgrade Node, then rebuild |
| Build fails with missing `tailwindcss` or `typescript` | `npm ci` ran without `--include=dev` |
| Camera does not start on phones | The page is not served over HTTPS, or camera permission was denied in the browser settings |
| `EADDRINUSE` on port 3066 | Another process holds the port: `sudo ss -ltnp 'sport = :3066'` |
| Certificate not issued | DNS does not point at the server yet, or ports 80/443 are blocked: `sudo journalctl -u caddy -n 100` |

Logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u after-augmented-reality -f
sudo journalctl -u caddy --since "10 minutes ago"
```
